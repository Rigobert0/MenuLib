# MenuLib
Library for creating interactive inventory menus in minecraft spigot plugins

WIP - do not use the Area-based components!!!

Current steps if you want to already use it:

1. git clone the project
2. use maven command 'clean compile package' to build a jar
3. add the jar as plugin to your server and as library to yur own project
